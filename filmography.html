											Sorting Room — Lighting & Layout Approach
											</p>
											<p>
											My role on this project was as a lead lighting technical director. The Sorting Room environment was constructed using a modular layout with extensive instancing to maximise efficiency and flexibility. 
											Once the layout was established, we instanced renderable light fixtures directly beneath each light housing.
											</p>
											<p>
											This lighting setup used an emissive bulb inside the housing to provide visible diffusion without contributing illumination to the wider environment. 
											Environmental lighting was instead handled by an area light positioned below the fixture. This approach significantly reduced render time and sampling
											noise, while also allowing independent control of light visibility without affecting scene illumination.
											</p>
											<p>
											By combining a highly instanced environment with an instanced lighting system, we were able to efficiently build, light, and render a large-scale 
											environment with minimal render resources. The heavy use of instancing also reduced cache management overhead, contributing to a more streamlined 
											and scalable pipeline.

										<h2>Working History</h2>
									</header>
										<p>
										I graduated from the Queensland College of Art in 2009 with a Bachelor of Animation and began my career in visual effects working in commercials. 
										Those early years were highly formative: deadlines were often extremely tight, expectations were high, and the work frequently sat outside a
										 traditional feature-film pipeline. This environment provided broad exposure across multiple disciplines, including fx, modelling, tracking,
										  compositing, lighting, rendering, rigging, and animation.
										</p>
										<p>
										During this time, I freelanced as a CG Generalist for a number of small studios, contributing to a wide range of projects for studios such as Motion Circus, Cutting Edge, Postmodern, and Alt VFX.
										</p>
										<p>
										My first feature film credit was Prometheus at Fuel VFX in Sydney, where I worked across FX simulations and lighting. From there, I went on to roles at Animal Logic in Sydney as a Lighting Artist, Framestore in London, and Iloura in Melbourne, before joining Wētā FX.
										</p>
										<p>
										Over the past ten years at Wētā FX, I have been fortunate to work alongside exceptionally talented and dedicated artists. During this time, I have progressed through roles including Lighting Technical Director, Lead Lighting Technical Director, and more recently, CG Supervisor.
